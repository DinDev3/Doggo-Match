# Doggo Match

### A MATCH MADE IN KENNEL!

Doggo Match is a game that tests a user&#39;s knowledge on various breeds of Dogs. The user can choose to either identify a breed from an image of a dog or identify a dog from the name of the breed. There&#39;s also an option to extend the user&#39;s knowledge on dog breeds by searching for a breed and viewing images of dogs related to that particular breed.
