### Identify the Dog Game

In this game, a random breed name is displayed together with the image of the breed and 2 other random dog images of random breeds. All 3 images displayed are of unique breeds. There&#39;s only one correct answer. The user is instructed to choose one image relevant to the breed displayed. The correctness of the chosen image will be notified to the user, below the name of the breed.
</br>When the countdown timer is turned on, if the user doesn&#39;t choose an image by the time the countdown timer reaches 0, the message &quot;Time&#39;s Up!&quot; will be displayed.

### Search Breed

The user can input a name of a dog breed into the text field displayed. When the Submit button is clicked, if the name entered exists in the app, a slideshow of images relevant to that breed will be shown to the user. This option is for the user to extend his/ her knowledge about dog breeds.
</br>The user can stop the slideshow by touching the &quot;Stop&quot; button.

## Basic functionalities developed in the game
- The CountDownTimer offered by Android OS was used for all countdown related events. The countdown timer was repeated whenever required by calling the start() method when the countdown timer finished ticking.
- The countdown timer ticks for 10 seconds in the first 2 games and for 5 seconds each in the &quot;Search Breeds&quot; slideshow. Every tick of the countdown timer occurs after 1 second.
- As soon as the countdown timer reaches 0, the result is displayed to the user.
- For the 2 and the slideshow, every single image displayed is unique.
- When the device is rotated from portrait to landscape and back to portrait, the application resumes from the exact same point (views &amp; data).
